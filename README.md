       My function is to apply online for surgery.  The patient must first enter their relevant information and submit the form.The entered information is then stored in a separate database containing the surgical details.  The user has the ability to edit and delete the entered information and it is displayed as a separate list.  In addition, there is a possibility to delete applications at once.  In addition, there is a separate page to access information on surgery fees.  In this case, if the person has insurance money, the sum will be deducted from the sum of the doctor charge and hospital charges, and if other special facilities are required, the relevant charges will be added separately and the total amount will be displayed
